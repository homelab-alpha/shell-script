        **üö´ Please Avoid Unnecessary Pings**

        We kindly ask all contributors to refrain from pinging maintainers unless absolutely necessary. Pings should be reserved for critical issues or urgent matters that require immediate attention.

        **Why**: Limiting pings to urgent matters helps maintainers focus on and prioritize essential tasks more effectively.
