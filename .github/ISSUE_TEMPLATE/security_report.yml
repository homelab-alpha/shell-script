        ## ‚ö†Ô∏è Security Issue Reporting

        ### **IMPORTANT: DO NOT INCLUDE ANY DETAILS HERE:**

        To report a vulnerability privately, please use the GitHub Security Advisory.

        This template is for notifying maintainers, as the GitHub Security Advisory
        system does **not** automatically notify the @homelab-alpha team.

        ### **Step 1:** Create a GitHub Security Advisory using the link below

        [Create a new Security Advisory](https://github.com/homelab-alpha/shell-script/security/advisories/new)

        ### **Step 2:** Once your advisory is created, paste the URL of your GitHub Advisory below

        **Example of a GitHub Advisory URL:**

        <https://github.com/homelab-alpha/shell-script/security/advisories/GHSA-9d2f-4v3j-p7qk>

        After creating your advisory report, paste the GitHub Advisory URL below.

  - type: "textarea"
    id: github-advisory-url
    validations:
      required: true
    attributes:
      label: "GitHub Advisory URL"
      placeholder: |
        Paste the GitHub Advisory URL here.
