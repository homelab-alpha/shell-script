# Maintainers

Our goal is to ensure the long-term viability and continuous improvement of this
project. To achieve this, we've established a clear and structured process for
adding new maintainers and defining their roles and responsibilities. We believe
in fostering a collaborative environment where diverse contributions are
recognized and valued.

## Becoming a Maintainer

> [!NOTE]
>
> At this time, we are not accepting new Maintainers or Junior Maintainers. See
> **“[Current Maintainers](#current-maintainers)”** for details.

If you're interested in contributing to the project's long-term success by
becoming a maintainer, you'll need to demonstrate a history of sustained and
meaningful contributions. These contributions are crucial for showcasing your
commitment and understanding of the project's codebase and community guidelines.

Your contributions can include, but are not limited to:

- **Pull Request Reviews**: Actively reviewing existing Pull Requests, providing
  constructive feedback, suggesting improvements, and helping to ensure code
  quality and adherence to project standards. Your insights help streamline the
  merge process and enhance the overall reliability of the project.
- **Code Contributions**: Submitting your own Pull Requests that introduce new
  features, resolve reported bugs, improve existing functionalities, or enhance
  documentation. High-quality code contributions demonstrate your technical
  proficiency and ability to integrate new solutions effectively.
- **Issue Management**: Participating in the discussion and resolution of
  reported issues, **including reproducing bugs or validating fixes**, providing
  support to other users, and helping to categorize and prioritize tasks.
- **Community Engagement**: Actively participating in project discussions,
  offering guidance to new contributors, and generally fostering a positive and
  welcoming community environment.

While your contributions don't need to be extensive in scale, consistency and
quality are key. We value a steady commitment to the project over infrequent,
large contributions.

### Process to Become a Junior Maintainer

1. Accumulate a clear record of ongoing, valuable contributions to the project,
   aligning with the types of contributions outlined above.
2. Create a Pull Request to add your GitHub handle and a direct link to your
   GitHub profile under the "Current Maintainers" section in this [MAINTAINERS]
   document, indicating your aspiration to be a Junior Maintainer. **Ensure your
   Pull Request description clearly outlines your motivations and highlights
   your most significant contributions.**
3. The existing maintainers will thoroughly review your submitted Pull Request,
   assess your past contributions, and engage in an internal discussion
   regarding your nomination. During this phase, they may reach out for further
   clarification or discussion.
4. Upon successful approval, your Pull Request will be merged. At this point,
   you will officially be granted the **Junior Maintainer** role, along with the
   necessary permissions and responsibilities.

## Maintainer Progression

The process described above is the entry point for becoming a **Junior
Maintainer**. Promotion to **Maintainer** and subsequently to **Senior
Maintainer** is handled differently. These roles are granted based on merit,
demonstrated expertise, consistent contributions, and trust earned within the
project.

Progression to a higher role is an internal process, initiated by existing
Maintainers or the Project Founder, and does not require a new Pull Request from
the candidate. It is a recognition of sustained commitment and leadership.

### How Promotion Works

- **Junior Maintainer** → **Maintainer**: Promotion occurs based on sustained
  contributions and leadership. The existing maintainers will discuss and
  nominate candidates for promotion, and the Project Founder will make the final
  decision.
- **Maintainer** → **Senior Maintainer**: Senior Maintainers are trusted leaders
  with deep expertise in the project. This promotion is initiated by existing
  Senior Maintainers or the Project Founder and reflects a candidate's ongoing
  commitment, technical acumen, and ability to mentor others.

## Maintainer Roles and Responsibilities

To ensure clear ownership and efficient project management, we categorize
maintainer roles with distinct responsibilities.

## Additional Guidelines

### Decision-Making Process

Decisions, especially concerning major changes, features, or maintainer
appointments, are generally made through **consensus** among the Senior
Maintainers and the Project Founder. However, the **Project Founder retains the
ultimate veto right** on all project decisions to ensure alignment with the
project's long-term vision and strategic direction. This ensures that while
collaborative decision-making is prioritized, the project's core vision remains
intact.

### Activity Expectations for Maintainers

To ensure the project remains active and well-maintained, we expect all
maintainers to show consistent engagement. We propose the following guidelines:

- **Junior Maintainers**: Expected to contribute at least **one meaningful
  contribution** (e.g., Pull Request review, bugfix, documentation update) per
  month. This helps in their learning and integration into the team.
  - A **meaningful contribution** is defined as an action that demonstrably adds
    value to the project, such as resolving a bug, adding a feature,
    significantly improving documentation, or providing a detailed and
    constructive pull request review that leads to improvement.

- **Maintainers**: Expected to contribute at least **two meaningful
  contributions** (e.g., Pull Request review, feature implementation, issue
  management) per month.
- **Senior Maintainers**: Expected to maintain a high level of activity,
  including **regular in-depth code reviews, active participation in
  architectural discussions, and mentoring**, with no specific numerical minimum
  as their contributions are often strategic and less frequent in volume but
  high in impact.

Should a maintainer become inactive for a period exceeding **three consecutive
months** without prior communication, the existing Project Founder and Senior
Maintainers will initiate a review of their role. This review may lead to a
discussion about their ability to continue in the role or, if necessary, their
removal from the active maintainer list.

### Stepping Down or Removal of Roles

- **Voluntary Resignation**: If a maintainer wishes to step down, they should
  notify the Project Founder or a Senior Maintainer **via a formal email**. A
  formal announcement will then be made to the community.
- **Involuntary Removal**: In cases of prolonged inactivity (as described above)
  or violations of community guidelines/[code of conduct], the Project Founder,
  in consultation with Senior Maintainers, may decide to remove a maintainer.
  The decision will be communicated privately to the individual first, followed
  by a general announcement if deemed necessary to inform the community of a
  change in the active maintainer list.

### Conflict Resolution

Conflicts within the maintainer team are resolved through a structured approach
to ensure fair and effective outcomes:

- **Open Discussion**: The first step is always an open and respectful
  discussion among the involved parties to understand all perspectives and find
  common ground.
- **Mediation by Senior Maintainer**: If a resolution is not reached, a neutral
  Senior Maintainer (not directly involved in the conflict) will act as a
  mediator to facilitate further discussion and guide the team towards a
  solution.
- **Project Founder's Decision**: If mediation fails, or in cases of significant
  disagreement affecting project direction or health, the Project Founder will
  make the final binding decision, leveraging their veto right as needed. The
  decision will be communicated clearly to all involved parties.

### Communication Channels

Maintainers primarily communicate via:

- **Email**: For day-to-day discussions, quick updates, and informal
  problem-solving.
- **GitHub Issues & Pull Request Comments**: For discussions directly related to
  code, features, and bugs.

### Contribution Review Frequency

We strive to review and merge contributions promptly, keeping the project moving
and supporting our contributors.

- **Timely Acknowledgment**: We'll acknowledge new Pull Requests within **5
  business days** to confirm receipt and provide an initial status.
- **Active Review**: Maintainers will actively engage in the review process,
  offering constructive feedback and working toward merging within a reasonable
  timeframe. While exact times can vary, we generally aim for a complete review
  cycle (from submission to merge) to be completed within **two weeks** for
  straightforward contributions. Complex contributions may take longer, and
  we'll communicate any anticipated delays.

We understand that review times can vary based on contribution complexity and
current maintainer workload. We're committed to transparent communication if
delays occur.

### CODEOWNERS File

To ensure that code changes are reviewed by the appropriate maintainers, we
utilize a [CODEOWNERS] file. This file, located at `.github/CODEOWNERS` in the
repository, specifies individuals or teams responsible for code in designated
paths.

Using a `CODEOWNERS` file helps to:

- **Automate Reviews**: Automatically request reviews from the specified code
  owners when a pull request modifies code in their area of responsibility.
- **Enforce Ownership**: Clearly define who is responsible for which parts of
  the codebase.
- **Streamline Workflow**: Expedite the review process by directing pull
  requests to the most knowledgeable maintainers.

### Security Considerations

Security is paramount for this project. All maintainers are expected to be aware
of and adhere to our [Security Policy]. Any reported security vulnerabilities
will be handled by the **Senior Maintainers** or the **Project Founder** in
accordance with this policy.

### Project Roadmap

The project's strategic direction and future development are guided by a
**Project Roadmap**. This roadmap outlines our long-term goals, major features,
and key initiatives. It serves as a living document, evolving with the needs of
the project and its community. Senior Maintainers are expected to actively
contribute to and help shape this roadmap, ensuring it aligns with the project's
vision.
