# Guidelines for Colors in the Speed Test Charts

1. **High contrast ratio** Ensure clear readability on both light and dark
   backgrounds.

2. **Color-blind friendly** Avoid critical combinations that are difficult to
   distinguish, such as pure red/green.

3. **Limited color palette** Use a maximum of 5–6 main colors to keep the charts
   clean and easy to interpret.

4. **Consistent accent colors** Use accent colors for averages, highlights, and
   exceptions, and apply them consistently throughout.

5. **Fixed transparency for fill colors** Use a standard transparency (20%) so
   lines and backgrounds do not visually interfere with each other.
